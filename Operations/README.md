Operations within the NiFi framework is a broad subject. I have removed the existing efforts here in favor of a completely new project called "nifi-device-registry"
which will capture all devices within a given ecosystem as well as operational metrics for them such as back pressured connections, processors that are invalid,
 cpu usage, memory, disk space, etc. This effort will run as an external microservice with NiFi ReportingTasks sending the information to the device registry
 where it will display the operational metrics to the end user through a single pane of glass. That effort can be found at https://github.com/jdye64/nifi-device-registry
